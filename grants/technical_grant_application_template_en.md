# Technical Grant Proposal

* **Project:** The name of the project

## Project Overview  

 * A brief description of the project.
 * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
 * An indication of what benefits will this project bring to the Alaya or PlatON ecosystem

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state, so that we can understand the project more intuitively.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* API specifications of the core functionality
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Project Advantages
If similar projects already exist in the ecosystem, please introduce the advantages and differences of your project compared to other projects.

### Team's experience
Please describe the team's relevant experience. If the project involves development work, we'd appreciated if you singled out a few interesting projects or contributions made by team members in the past.

## Development Roadmap
This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, and how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.

For each milestone:
   - make sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories here.
   - include the amount of funding requested per milestone.
   - include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
   - provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
   - indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
   - Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).
